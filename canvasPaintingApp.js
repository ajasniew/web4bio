// draw on a Canvas requires several important steps:
// 1.  setting up your HTML document with a Canvas context (a <canvas> element with an id)
// setting up your script to target that Canvas context and draw inside it
// adding the required mouse event handlers for user interaction and associated logic
// once the event handlers are in place, it's then fairly simple to add any desired functionality
